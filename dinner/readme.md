## Servings: 
4

## Time to prepare: 
40 minutes

## Ingredients:
4 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts
1/2 Tablespoon Smoked Paprika
3 Tablespoons Unsalted butter, divided
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
2 Tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
Juice of 1 lemon
Splash of dry white wine
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
2 cups fresh spinach
1/4 teaspoon salt
Fresh cracked pepper, to taste
8 oz cooked rice or pasta


## Equipment needed:
Oven
Oven-proof skillet
Pot


## Steps for preparation:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Season the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika. Set aside.
3. Melt 2 Tablespoons of butter in a large oven-proof skillet (a Le Creuset Dutch Oven works well or a
RockCrok or cast iron skillet) over medium high heat.
4. Add the chicken and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove and set
chicken aside on separate plate.
5. While the chicken is resting, return back to the same skillet and melt remaining tablespoon of butter in
the skillet. Add garlic and saute for 2 more minutes.
6. Stir in chicken broth, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, splash of wine and thyme.
7. Bring sauce to a boil and reduce heat. Add in the spinach and parsley and simmer until the spinach and
parsley has wilted and the sauce has slightly thickened.
8. Continue to cook the sauce about 5-7 minutes so the sauce becomes thicker. You don't want the sauce to
become too runny!
9. Once your sauce is to the desired thickness, return the chicken to the oven proof dish.
10. Place in the oven and cook for 30 minutes.
11. Remove the dish and let sit for about 5 minutes before serving. Top with fresh chopped parsley
12. Serve with cooked rice or pasta


### Notes:
Super yummy and easy to make - the buttery sauce is amazing!
